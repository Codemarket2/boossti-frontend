      <Panel title="About" isActive={activeIndex === 0} onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}>
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to
        1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology" isActive={activeIndex === 1} onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}>
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often
        translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the
        ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a
        likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
